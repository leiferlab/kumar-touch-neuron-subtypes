## kumar-touch-neuron-subtypes

## This is the code used to collect and analyze the data presented in: Li*, Kumar*, Poon, Leifer, and Zheng, "Functional Interrogation of Neuronal Subtypes via Intersectional Expression of Optogenetic Actuator Reveals Non-linear Components in a Linear Circuit"

## Below are the codes to collect behavioral datasets from two different instruments: <br/>
a. Whole worm illumination setup: The associated code for collecting data from the whole field illumination setup is in the whole_field_illumination_setup folder. This setup is used to collect the data presented in Figures 2 and 4. <br/>
b. Targeted illumination setup: The associated code for collecting data from targeted illumination of head and/or tail neurons is present in the targeted_illumination_setup folder. This setup is used to collect the data presented in Figure 3. <br/>

## Installation requirements:
 - LabVIEW 2019 64-bit Windows
 - LabVIEW package manager
 - LabVIEW OpenG add-on
 - HDF5 v1.8.18+ (latest v1.8 but not v1.10)
 - h5labview
