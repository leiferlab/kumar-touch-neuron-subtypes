# kumar-touch-neuron-subtypes

# This is the code used to collect and analyze the data presented in: Li*, Kumar*, Poon, Leifer, and Zheng, "Functional Interrogation of Neuronal Subtypes via Intersectional Expression of Optogenetic Actuator Reveals Non-linear Components in a Linear Circuit"

## Below are the codes to collect behavioral dataset from two different instruments: <br/>
a. Whole worm illumination setup: The associated code for collecting data from whole field illumination setup is present in whole_field_illumination_setup folder. This setup is used to collect the data presented in Figure 2 and 4. <br/>
b. Targeted illumination setup: The associated code for collecting data from targeted illumination of head and/or tail neurons is present in targeted_illumination_setup folder. This setup is used to collect the data presented in Figure 2 and 4. <br/>

## Installation requirements:
